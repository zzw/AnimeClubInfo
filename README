We are going to build a website for the Anime Club in SWUFE. At present they do not have a website to present their achievement in all kinds of competitions, such as ChinaJoy, Animation Festival in western China. Because of a great demand of cosers(角色扮演者), they need a website to put their wanted ads. Besides, this website will be a very good platform to share anime resources. 

Outline or list of basic parts for the site and possible modules.
主页：Views collection
掠影：Presenting their achievement in all kinds of competitions
漫坛动态：Updating the latest news about the anime
活动与招新：Putting wanted ads and activity information
关于与田：Introdution of the club
论坛：A forum where users can discuss the themes they are interested in.
与田专区：A place where the members of this club can use the key to enroll a group(like the groups in language-corner).
